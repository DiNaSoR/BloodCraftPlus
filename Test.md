a lot of the time my familiar is perfectly fine (+1000 hp, pretty much equal SP/PP) but sometimes it ends up like that

There are both client and server side V Rising mods, if you're playing in singleplayer / localhost you probably need ServerLaunchFix installed in order to run any server mods. You can check if a mod is tagged as a server or client mod in the tags on thunderstore.
https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/Mythic/ServerLaunchFix/

Please note that SLF will take 5-15min to finish copying .dll files over, it is common to not be able to connect for a moment the first time it is used.

I'm an old woman, and I don't understand the whole "base stat cap" "synergies" and multipliers there. What about an ELI5?
Aside from that, is there a way to put a familiar I want to a different box? When you have 40+, it gets difficult remembering where my favorite was.

KazanKashish — 2025-12-27 09:10 PM
hello...is there any resource to read about prestige-ing
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2025-12-27 09:33 PM
Outside of the readme and your config, there is nothing to read, some servers make their own guides but there is no universal guide - you hit max level you prestige by running the respective prestige command for [experience] which is pre-requesite for [exo] (prestiging for exo form) and you prestige for [blood legacy] for each blood-type same rather than conventional leveling & killing like 'experience' you need "to bite to kill" or kill and feed on V Bloods to grind up "essence" which works like xp for said "blood legacy" and run the respective command for blood each time you hit lvl 100 in blood, stats with a synergy for your class will acquire a 20% bonus at max lvl (can be higher depending upon your settings). Then you have [weapon expertise] same principle as blood expect you can just freely use said weapons on whatever targets with your weapon just level your weapons to max level and run the respective prestige command for weapons stats are respective for "weapon expertise" and will also acquire a bonus at maximum leveled prestige for weaponry. Lastly are Familiars, the bonus of which is very small as of v1.1 due to internal changes to the game so unless you gear them up and max out their respective prestige you won't see much of a change.
KazanKashish — 2025-12-27 09:44 PM
Thank you for the quick response. this is better than what I have found so far... so TYVM 🙂
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2025-12-27 09:53 PM
Np, you can read the synergies for each class at the bottom of your Bloodcraft config: "io.zfolmt.Bloodcraft.cfg" under the section [classes] it will give you an idea of what stats for blood and weapon are ideal per each class.
Veiledbyamask — 2025-12-28 02:50 AM
Hello hello! Sorry if this is a stupid question, but we played with leveling enabled for a while, realised it wasn't for us and disabled it again... but now levels are broken :'D Even after I set everyone to level 0 while unarmed and not wearing anything and then disabled leveling, once we put our equipment back on it's adding it up weirdly. For example, with my gear + weapon, I'm now at a proud level 178.
How do I fix that?
Image
Veiledbyamask — 2025-12-28 02:59 AM
It also keeps resetting my base level (unarmed) to 90 for some reason, even with completely removing the mod :')
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2025-12-28 03:06 AM
Bloodcraft handles player data separately when uninstalled you likely missed all of said files those need to be manually removed.
Veiledbyamask — 2025-12-28 03:07 AM
So to disable just leveling, do I have to mess with the player data separately?

Imperivm Draconis

Disable the leveling in the cfg, and remove the player data files if you want to make a clean uninstall of Bloodcraft
Otherwise the player data will always interfere with your game
Veiledbyamask — 2025-12-28 03:09 AM
Oh I just found it! Thank you so much 🙏 
I don't wanna completely remove Bloodcraft (we really enjoy the familiars. The pokemon urge to catch 'em all) just the leveling wasn't for us :lul: 
So I imagine if I just disable leveling and then delete the player_experience.json that will do the trick?
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2025-12-28 03:10 AM
Yes well if you don't want to uninstall I don't suggest you removing the enfire "Bloodcraft" folder under "Config".

Yeah I'm not going to :lul: I figured
Thanks so much for the help!
Imperivm Draconis

1st use the admin command for bloodcraft to set your level to 0
then disable leveling in "io.zfolmt.Bloodcraft.cfg".
Veiledbyamask — 2025-12-28 03:12 AM
I did do that before, yes
But it still would set our base levels back for some reason, hence why I came here for help;;
But knowing about the separate player stats in the actual bloodcraft folder helps a lot, thank you ^^
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2025-12-28 03:17 AM
If you've not already done so be sure to run the following commands 1st...
.weapon set [Name] [Weapon] [Level]

.profession set [Name] [Profession] [Level]

.prestige set [Name] [PrestigeType] [Level]
Set those all to zeros
Then you can just remove the individual files and they will regenerate defaults upon next game reboot/server-restart.

unequip weapons, armor, amulet & re-equip - this should flush the values.

I'll try removing the mod as a whole now after all, as a last resort, and see if that helps
Veiledbyamask — 2025-12-28 04:23 AM

D. — 2026-01-07 05:39 AM
Yeah! We're on a Brutal Bloodcraft server, I've already made enemies in general stronger and vbloods much much stronger lmao so im trying to find out which familiars seem to be op or beneficial in general
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-07 05:41 AM
Well, given that Familiar stats were nerfed internally as of the Oakveil Update - Maxxed Familiars will still be relatively weak compared to how they were in v1.0 of this game. I would start with two or three things in mind.
Unobtainable Units: CHAR_Militia_Horseman     -235172198 (Mounted NPC) not found in the base game but exist in the files. CHAR_Gloomrot_AceIncinerator     1756241788 (A more exiciting version of the standard Gloomrot Pyros that also fly via Jetpacks like Ziva does). Also, not found in the base game but exists in the game files.
Any summoner unit or healer unit.
Any unit V Blood or Standard which propagates debuffs such as Condemn, Ignite, Burn, etc. (Unholy if playing a DeathMage, Illusion if playing an ArcaneSorc with pure Illusion build, etc).
 
And many Non V Blood familiars are much better familiars due to HP scaling, as even a maxxed Familiar that is a V Blood will be weaker than its in-game counterpart. 
D. — 2026-01-07 05:45 AM
I thought of a healer unit, I'm trying to figure out classes a bit, but that last tip is really good i didn't think of that. 
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-07 05:47 AM
Healers are useful till a point and much the same for any Familiar really, they're useful for mundane fights but pretty much worthless for the Shard-Bearers (especially if you have Elite buffs enabled on them).
It was different back in v1.0 when healing familiars was much more effective I could keep "some units" alive all the way to the last phase of Elite Dracula (Ace Incinerator, Blood Golem), but as I pointed out above v1.1 altered the ingame components used for the "legacy familiar prestige system", not possible in the current version of the game.
D. — 2026-01-07 05:51 AM
Yeah I was trying to search in here and saw some comments from the last few years regarding them, i think i tried a fam and was like this isnt as strong as they said lol

On the topic of classes, is there any you felt personally that were fun, I've tried doing like an unarmed death mage im still like early act 3 and i feel so crappy without my weapons lol
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-07 05:57 AM
I love unarmed, my 1st playthrough as a Deathmage was unarmed, it like advanced mode now in v1.1 but still do'able.
My main class is a VampireLord though I like the flexibility of the class it's a no BS class as well.
My 2nd fave class is BloodKnight when I just want to melee and forget about using any spells outside of Bloodrite and Bloodrage.
D. — 2026-01-07 05:59 AM
I actually was about to change to bloodknight to just meat shield lmao
i might have to check out vamp lord

Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-07 05:59 AM
DeathMage was my 1st class in v1.0 it's now my 3rd favorite class, I feel it's proper to demote it because it's an overall easier playthrough as a DM, the other two classes are more challenging to master.
D. — 2026-01-07 06:00 AM
if i stay death mage is there like a setup you'd recommend i havent done my weapon stats yet either, i just wasn't 100% sure what to commit to lol

Yes, go unarmed pure unholy summoner with either Makta or Kriig as your Familiar.

Yes, you are able to swap out the prefabs for class "shift" spells by replacing the default prefab guid string with custom ones. You can do this by manually replacing each one with another prefab guid which you can find here. https://wiki.vrisingmods.com/prefabs/AB (AB = Ability Groups, also use at your own risk, not all non-player AB_groups work for players, animations might be off at times and there is also balance/performance stability to bear in mind of).

Same thing as a prestige you acquire a 20% bonus to your stats applied to said weapon-type just like blood-type the numbers go up with each prestige rank this is to ensure that players can handle the late-game Elite content provided via Bloodcraft such as Primal Rift Events & Elite Shard Bearers.

Reference your Config for that.
I set up a complete currency system for my old server it's something that you as a server owner should spend time on setting up, if you're capable of setting up custom shift spells you're also fully able to set up independent currency costs for things like crafting gems via Bloodcraft, class change/prestige stat change currencies and what not.

Is there any way someone would be willing to post their configs for bloodcraft? I’m finding already that my scaling might be a bit off as I’m running through brutal without issue. I’ve mostly not touched the default configs and want to see something in comparison. I’ve not started even applying stats and blood level ups
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-11 12:58 AM
A more comprehensive UI with command-line pre-loaded into a unified interface is still a work in progress. if you give yourself the "developer tag" you can give yourself a preview of such here: ⁠⌨│programming⁠ but for currently the only fully supported companion UI is Eclipse also there is the "only fams" (Bloodcraft UI extension - intended to be used with Eclipse) but I've heard mixed reports from users who've stated that their "familiars vanish" when using said mod and I cannot vouch as to whether or not said issue is resolved.

If you're running regular Brutal settings it's not recommended to amp the config settings Bloodcraft-side. But if not, it would greatly vary upon your "customized Brutal" experience.

Hey! I really love the bloodcraft mod, but I often run into the issue that I cant really play alone, while my friends are offline, since I will accumulate exp and there will be a significant mismatch;
Is it possible to make an option to "freeze" the exp in place as a player toggle?

There’s rested xp settings that you can configure for when they’re offline so when they’re on, catchup will be easier
ZeN — 2026-01-11 04:25 AM
Mhh, not quite what I am looking for to be honest, since then it might be the other way around, if I decide to simply farm without killing enemies and they get tons of exp from the rested bonus while I maybe earned none

Is playing a full physical build viable mid to endgame?
In normal VRising Spellbuilds do significantly more damage than pure physical builds, I am wondering if thats the same in Bloodcraft
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 12:46 PM
It's viable for an entire playthrough for example: [BloodKnight] from Bloodcraft.

The bonus stats from synergies for a class are for all spells of your class's spell school, or just for the ones that you can equip as a "shift spell" ?

Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 09:48 PM
Shift spells sourced from AB_groups (NPCs) do not scale from stats such as SP they have fixed values, the only thing they're influenced by are spell gems if using standard spells. The stats for for class synergies are only applied via specific stats for specific classes as 20% bonus to effects for example: MaxHP on the BK & VL, SP and SCR on the ArcaneSorc, etc. They apply to all equipped weapons and standard spells if related to Primary/Physical/Spell/Leech where applicable for each one. 
Nostra

 — 2026-01-15 10:51 PM
So the stat synergies are just a 1.5x boost (default setting) to the stats given by your weapon and blood levels, and do not interact with the class spells you get from prestige?
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 10:53 PM
Unless they're vanilla spells (which is the default), but assuming you're using NPC abilities (AB_groups), no.
Nostra

 — 2026-01-15 10:56 PM
I'm using the vanilla settings, so my class's spells are vanilla spells. Does this mean that if im an arcane sorcerer I should use illusion spells because they get 50% more spell power and crit etc?
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 10:57 PM
ArcaneSorc benefits from all spells but you should use Illusion if you want to benefit from the phantasm stack bonus as an AS, might not be ideal leveling Illusion as the entire play-through but viable for late-game.
Nostra

 — 2026-01-15 11:03 PM
Is there a special interaction between the AS class and the phantasm bonus?
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 11:05 PM
Each class has a passive - illusion being one for AS, you can take advantage of that or not, up to you.
Nostra

 — 2026-01-15 11:05 PM
Oh you mean the passive off triggering the spell school passive with my auto attacks?
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 11:06 PM
Yes and that each class has passives corresponding to each school, this is also indicated via the class color text you can see in game chat and via Eclipse.
Nostra

 — 2026-01-15 11:08 PM
Ooh okay, I'm using unarmed for I can have 4 spells, so I don't use my basic attacks much as they don't deal any damage. There isn't any way to have 4 spells with normal weapons right, it's a trade off?
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 11:12 PM
your basic attack from unarmed scales from "Primary Damage" but unless you're physical you won't benefit from very much output damage if you're an unarmed caster, that is the trade-off. I you want to be physical-focused it's ideal with weapons, possible with unarmed (I've had players on my old server go toe to toe with Dracula via "unarmed"), the main benefit of unarmed is for spell-casting. 
Nostra

Imperivm Draconis

Are your server-side settings boosting your Bloodmoon buff in any capacity? By default it grants 10% of a bonus to your blood buffs, damage output and + overall movement speed. 
Nostra

 — 2026-01-15 11:33 PM
Nop im using default brutal settings
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 11:34 PM
What you're experiencing isn't a boost from the Bloodmoon buff in itself then, Bloodcraft is not intended to compliment default Brutal settings, you will end up feeling overpowered.
Bloodcraft was intended for "Brutal+"

For some reason there is a significant increase in power during bloodmoon tho
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 11:36 PM
Like I said it's not the Bloodmoon in itself, it's the 10% boost from the Bloodmoon buff atop of your Bloodbuffs + Bloodcraft's boosted stats.
Nostra

 — 2026-01-15 11:36 PM
Do you have any settings you reccomend? I do not want it to feel too hard for new players, especially in the beginning, but this late same is a bit of a joke rn
Imperivm Draconis

 — 2026-01-15 11:37 PM
Not that I can recommend to the layperson, no - my old server was Brutal+++ (Nightmare Brutal) with a 40% Bloodmoon buff.
It's impossible to give a comphrehensive guide for that because everyone has their personal "comfy spot" for Brutal and every server is a little different.
Plus adjusting the Bloodcraft config as per "ServerGameSettings" is also difficult to suggest, you'll have to feel it out.

Imperivm Draconis

Bloodcraft is the original by Mitch, Bloodcraft+ is a branch as cited in the credits.
I have not touched BC+ as it's a new release barely a day old and I'm no longer active in-game and I cannot actively verify what the difference is asides from alleged UI components expanding out of the "attributes tab".

If you're running the mod as single-player on your local-client you need SLF.

 — Yesterday at 05:33 AM
There are both client and server side V Rising mods, if you're playing in singleplayer / localhost you probably need ServerLaunchFix installed in order to run any server mods. You can check if a mod is tagged as a server or client mod in the tags on thunderstore.
https://v-rising.thunderstore.io/package/Mythic/ServerLaunchFix/

Please note that SLF will take 5-15min to finish copying .dll files over, it is common to not be able to connect for a moment the first time it is used.

I activated T3 rifts on my server and they're working but it seems like it's ONLY T3 rifts and the normal rifts no longer happen. Should the number in the bottom setting not be 0? It's confusing to be what it means
Image
Imperivm Draconis

 — 01:34 AM
0 means T3 Rifts will never appear the string frequency is by order of even numbers 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24
24 being the max value.
On my server it's 14 so that mostly T3 rifts appear and sometimes T2 and rarely T1
You will also need to jumpstart rifts via the system console command [~] the very 1st time.
Imperivm Draconis

 — 01:42 AM
'WarEvent_Start Primal' (To jumpstart your Primal Rift events the 1st time).
Nostra

 — 01:54 AM
That's weird ;| in my server with these settings Tier 3 rifts are the ONLY rift that spawns
Image
Imperivm Draconis

 — 02:37 AM
is this before or after you messed with the cfg?
When you re-input new variables in the config for rifts - reboot the server, if you need to end current rift events you can do so via the system console
the re-initiate the T3 rift events "once" via the system console, from there on out they will propagate via the normal timed rift events.
Nostra

 — 02:39 AM
Once I activated the tier 3 rifts and restarted the server they were immediately active, despite me leaving the number at 0
Imperivm Draconis

 — 02:40 AM
0 = null or if with rifts activated they override all rifts which means 100 and will eclipse all normal rift events
As I said the normal string is a sequence of even numbers only. 
1/0 will result in undesirable effects
24 being the max stable cap, but the input should be at your own discretion.
Nostra

 — 02:42 AM
I set the frequency to 10 and restarted the server
The rifts are still active as tier 3 currently
I tried starting a tier 1 rift through console but that didn't really work
Imperivm Draconis

 — 02:43 AM
End them via the system console
Nostra

 — 02:45 AM
They could also be visual artifacts in UI did you teleport to the rift to verify if it was active?
Nostra

 — 02:45 AM
Yes
it was active as a tier 3
I used the warevent_schedule Minor 1
and it worked
there's only 1 active rift now and it's tier 1
Imperivm Draconis

 — 02:45 AM
Ok
My only other word of advice for the sake of debugging would be to refresh your config setting for 'T3 rift events' change them to defaults, reboot server and trigger either a T1/T2 event via the console (But only if you continue to have issues) then active the module in your config settings/rinse repeat. 
But if it works all should be fine for the time being.

Is it possible to check the event "queue" if I'm honest I don't fully understand how rift events trigger
Imperivm Draconis

 — 02:50 AM
They will work with the normal in game timers there is a bit of text cut off in the UI with T3 Primal rifts but they work on timer just like T1-T2 rift events.
You'll be able to predict them on the upper right hand side granted you won't be able to read the entirety of the text.
But they work. 🌶️

refresh your Eclipse as well if you have issues you can do so by pressing the blood orb to hide the Eclipse HUD and again to make it re-appear at times the UI will need a refresh when the values don't match.

Imperivm Draconis

 — 04:15 AM
There are 10 ranks to prestige as the 5 class "shift" spells is only the default number. After 10 ranks of Experience Prestige you have Exo which has 100 ranks to handle how long you can maintain each exoform.
